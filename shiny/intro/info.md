_Calicantus_ is a service developed to collect and visualize air quality data. The service is under development, but already usable. Most of the Italian regional environmental agencies participate in this project. So far, they share __PM10 observed data__, every day.  

Through an interactive web interface, you can explore and analyze the data. Interactive maps, cluster analysis and other tools facilitate the visualization and help the interpretation of past pollution episodes and of the current situation. Furthermore, __air quality forecasts__ for today and three days ahead are shown, provided by seven chemistry-transport models of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. 

The access to the platform is reserved for air quality experts of the public environmental agencies and, with some restrictions, to researchers, air quality modelling experts and public administrators.

Although it is developed in the framework of the Italian National Environmental Protection System (_SNPA_), _calicantus_ is open to __experts from around the world__, as end-users. Participation, as data providers, of environmental agencies of the European and Mediterranean area is welcome. We are ready to collect data shared through different protocols (FTP, HTTP), in different formats (CSV, JSON). Data from "Dipartimento del Territorio Cantone Ticino" (Switzerland) and Croatian Environment Agency are already in our data stream.

The platform code is written in the [R language](http://www.r-project.org) and available on a [public repository](https://www.github.com/jobonaf/calicantus). Suggestions for further developments and reporting of errors are welcome.
